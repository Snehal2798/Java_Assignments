/*

- You are developing a program for a sports day event where two athletes participated in a race. The school wants to know who completed the race in less time so they can declare the winner.

Your task is to write a program that:
Takes the race completion time (in seconds) for both athletes as input

Compares the times using an if-else statement

Displays who completed the race faster or if itâ€™s a tie
